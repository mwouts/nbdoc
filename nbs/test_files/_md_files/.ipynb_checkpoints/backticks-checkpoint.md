Hey I am going to see what happens when we have things like `@conda` and `@batch`, but you will not convert conda to a link because it isn't in back ticks.

If something isn't in the index like `@lorem`, nothing will happen.

```py
In code fences you will not convert links `@conda`
```

# Some other md

this is another test: `function_with_types_in_docstring`
